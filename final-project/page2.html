<p>Women have fought tirelessly for a countless amount of things throughout history. They fought for the right to vote, their own sexual freedom, equal job opportunities, equal pay, equal education, the right to their own bodies... the list could go on for awhile. No one should have to fight for equality, but unfortunately, in our society, people do have to, and women have been participating in this ongoing fight for centuries. 
</p>
<p>The history of feminism is a very deep, layered subject with an explanation that could fill up several novels. Instead of going into extensive detail on feminism itself, I want to highlight certain women who acted as key components in the feminist movement throughout history.

    <p class = "SojTruth"><span class="WomanExample">Sojourner Truth</span> was a former slave and an activist who focused heavily on women's rights and the abolishment of slavery in the 1800s. She is well-known for her famous speech "Ain't I a Woman?"-- a piece in which she urges the need for women to have equal rights and emphasizes her own capabilities as a woman. </p>
    <button id="next2"><strong>show more</strong></button>
    <p class="AudreL"><span class="WomanExample">Audre Lorde</span> was a Black lesbian author who advocated heavily for women, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color in her work throughout the mid to late 1900s. She provided important insight to the experience of being a Black queer woman in America. Her work made a great impact of enlightening people on aspects of feminism that often went vastly unnoticed.</p>
    <button id="next3"><strong>show more</strong></button>
    <p class="RBG2"><span class="WomanExample">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</span> was the first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. She stood for women's  rights issues and political reform until her death in 2020. Despite experiencing discrimination due to her gender while receiving her education, she went on to become an incredibly powerful and influential woman in politics and the feminist movement.  <br> <br> These are only a few of the countless amount of women who made an impact in women's history. I encourage you, as you further your own knowledge on feminism, to do individual research on the different women you come across. All of their stories are incredibly inspiring, and this website just barely scratches the surface of what some have accomplished.</p>
