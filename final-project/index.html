<p>This website is dedicated to tell the stories of different women-- through both history and personal accounts. I've spent the past year diving deeper into feminist idealogy and furthering my understanding of experiences that women have gone through in the past, and what we are still experiencing today. I believe that change cannot be made without education. But education is not always acquired in a formal setting. Social media, online articles, and trends have aided in growing users' knowledge of what feminism means, and what they can do to make a change. That is why I wanted to make a website dedicated to this topic.  </p>
