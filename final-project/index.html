<p>This website is dedicated to telling the stories of different women-- through both history and personal accounts. I've spent the past year diving deeper into feminist idealogy and furthering my understanding of experiences that women have gone through in the past, and what we are still experiencing today. I believe that change cannot be made without education. But education is not always acquired in a formal setting. Social media, online articles, and websites have aided in growing users' knowledge of what feminism means, and what they can do to make a change. That is why I wanted to make a website dedicated to this topic. </p>

<p>This website contains a section dedicated to <strong>feminist history </strong>that highlights certain women who were incredibly impactful on the feminist movment. It gives a very brief overview of women's history and feminsim as a whole, and will hopefully <strong>inspire </strong>you to want to learn more about the subject. </p>

<p>There is also a section dedicated to the <strong>personal stories </strong>of influential women in my life. This section will showcase the <strong>power </strong>that women still exude today, even if they aren't well known in the media. I encourage everyone reading this to ask women in your life about their own stories. You will learn more than you anticipated.</p>
