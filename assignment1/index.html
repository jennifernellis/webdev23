    <main>  
      <p> I really enjoyed reading this article. I really do think that it is crazy just how influential and popular the web itself has become in such a short amount of time from its creation. I do not know a single person who does not actively use the web every single day in some way. And, of course, when there is something that is so influential on the public, businesses and corporations are going to want to take advantage of that influence with any chance they can get. I don’t think that businesses spreading their company across the web is really a bad thing. I do think that there could be bad things that could potentially stem from that, though. I believe there is growing concern and uneasiness in how different websites and companies are using our personal information and data. I have definitely grown more and more cautious and questioning of cyber security over the past few years. I also believe that the web has made it easier than ever for brands to promote their products (even if they are not good products). With the rise of the internet, we now have “influencers” who get paid large sums to promote and recommend certain products, even if they have never used the product before, or maybe even dislike it. This leads to thousands of people being influenced and purchasing a product that may not even be that great. I think that the internet in general has also increased consumerism greatly in the past years. It seems that every day on Tik Tok, there is a new article of clothing, makeup product, food, or other random objects trending. Brands and businesses are quick to take advantage of this, which makes sense obviously but still– it is crazy to think of how much easier it is for people to be influenced and become intense consumers with the web.</p>

      <p> With that being said, I think the web has introduced an amazing way of being able to access valuable information with ease. With the web, you can find information on any topic within seconds, whereas before you maybe would have had to spend a very long time looking for your information at a physical location like a library. Of course, there’s a great chance that if you are looking for information on a news event, you could very well come across a website with a very strong bias, which could be unhelpful. As annoying as that can be, I do not think it will ever change, as the first principles of the web were founded on openness, even if not always appropriate.
      </p>

      <p> I think that like all things, the web can be used for a lot of good, and definitely for just as much bad. But I believe that whether or not you think it weighs more on the good side or the bad side, it has made one of the biggest impacts on society and business as a whole. The web is only growing to be more and more significant as time moves on, so I think that it is very important that we strive to educate future generations about cyber security and safety, as I think that is much more important than some people may realize, and it will also only grow to be a more important topic as time progresses. While it is understandable to have fears about the power and influence of the web, I believe it can also be a really cool thing to think about, and can be a creative outlet for what you wanna do with your future.
